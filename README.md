# Clean Atch Book App

This repository is a playground for exploring and practicing Clean Architecture principles in Flutter development. My primary goal here is to deepen my understanding of software architecture and design best practices by applying them in a real project.

## Purpose

- **Learning Clean Architecture**: This app is structured to follow the Clean Architecture approach, separating concerns into distinct layers (Presentation, Domain, Data).
- **Experimentation**: This project serves as a sandbox to experiment with architectural decisions, refactoring, and testing various design patterns.
- **Best Practices**: Throughout the codebase, I strive to apply best practices in code organization, dependency management, and maintainability.

## What You'll Find

- Modular structure emphasizing separation of concerns.
- Well-defined feature folders.
- Use of dependency injection and inversion of control.
- Clear distinction between UI, business logic, and data sources.
- Practical examples of repositories, use cases, and entities.
- Comments and documentation to highlight architectural choices.

## Why This Matters

Clean Architecture helps build scalable, maintainable, and testable apps. By experimenting and learning in this repository, I aim to improve my skills in designing robust Flutter apps and share insights with others interested in architectural excellence.

## Getting Started

To run the project:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Feel free to explore the code, ask questions, or suggest improvements!

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the works of Robert C. Martin ("Uncle Bob") and the Clean Architecture community, as well as various online resources and courses.
